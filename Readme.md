# poVeR play

A VR (Virtual Reality) based game play environment, solely using smartphones (or smart watches) and a VR Headset.
The player will be playing a sport (supposedly cricket) while wearing a VR headset and holding a smartphone in the hands as a playing tool (supposedly a bat or a ball). The idea is to develop a virtual Play Station alternative wherein no additional hardware is required whatsoever, thereby reducing the cost of playing for about thousand times. Furthermore, the smartphones may connect to other smartphones joining the gaming network (via Wi-Fi) and users may play the same game simultaneously at different locations, performing different roles (batting at one location and bowling at another). This gaming experience is expected to bring a boom in gaming industry.
